<h1>Angular Bazel Example</h1>

<h2>
    Build, test and deploy at scale with the Cloud
</h2>

Bazel uses a remote cache of intermediate build artifacts, so even your first build is incremental.
When Bazel has a lot of build or test work, it can use extra machines on the Cloud to massively parallelize the work.
Even deployments can be incremental, using Docker layers.

<h2>
    Works with Angular CLI 
</h2>

Use the same <code>ng</code> commands you're used to.

<h2>
    Part of Angular Labs
</h2>

Still not a stable, supported API, so use Bazel with caution in production applications.
We expect to promote it to stable in Angular v9.

    Navigating the example

This application mimics a developer console for a cloud provider.
There are ten sections in the left nav, which represent ten different teams that contribute their functionality to the single-page application.
This is similar to how Google Cloud Console is developed with Bazel.
